# Data Vizualization Using Tableau

Tableau is a leading data analysis software used by analytics, banking and consulting organizations for data analysis. Tableau helps users to design/develop/deploy data science algorithms without writing huge chunks of code. The visualization of data joins and merges provides an easy way for a non-technical user to work on Data without worrying about coding in traditional scripting languages. In this course, I learned about Tableau visualization from scratch to a professional level of understanding. I also understood the techniques for building effective visualizations on various public data sets. The course consisted of bi-weekly assignments which mainly focus towards a target problem and building visualization to discovery significant insights. There was also a final project for students like me to apply knowledge for a practical dataset and present their story-telling skills through interesting data visualizations. This course will enabled me to gain all the important skills needed for building data visualizations and effective story telling.
